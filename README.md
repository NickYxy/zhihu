# zhihu
A copy of zhihu

I'd like to make a complete copy of zhihu as best as I can, setp by step, trying to make every function perform well as expected.

You can start server with python3 zhihu.py server.

mongo服务启动方法：

mongod --dbpath /Users/username/data/db

With the purpose to run project normally, please run sh start.sh in your shell/Terminal.

sh start.sh

注：为调试css和js，应在 chrome - Network 启用「disable cache」。
